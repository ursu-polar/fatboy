# Fatboy
***About the game:***
Second Unity 2D project, Fatboy is a pointy-move-it-grab-it-miss-it kind of game for Android devices. The plot is unknown so far but could be added later.

***Main game loop mechanic:***
Things drop from the top of the screen. You can move your character left to right and right to left by touch (drag or point). When you hit the falling items, you either:
- grow
- shrink
- reset to initial size
For each item "eaten" you get points. There is a timer but so far it does nothing (maybe give points for longest survival time?). If you reach the top of the screen or an area at the top of the screen, you die and the game ends.
